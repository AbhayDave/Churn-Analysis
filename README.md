# Churn Analysis Project: Understanding and Predicting Customer Attrition

## Overview

In today's competitive business landscape, retaining customers is paramount for sustained success. This project focuses on churn analysis, a vital technique for understanding and mitigating customer attrition. By examining customer data, we aim to identify patterns and drivers behind customer departures. Leveraging data analytics and machine learning, this project predicts which customers are at risk of churning and provides actionable insights to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Although this project focuses on churn analysis for a telecom firm, the techniques and insights are applicable across various industries. From retail and finance to healthcare and beyond, any business that values customer retention can benefit from churn analysis. We explore the methods, tools, and best practices for reducing churn and improving customer loyalty, transforming data into actionable insights for sustained success.

## Project Goals

This project aims to:

*   **Visualize and Analyze Customer Data:** Create a comprehensive view of customer data across demographic, geographic, payment, account information, and service usage levels.
*   **Study Churner Profiles:** Identify key characteristics and behaviors of churned customers.
*   **Implement Targeted Marketing Campaigns:** Pinpoint areas where marketing efforts can be focused to reduce churn.
*   **Predict Future Churners:** Develop a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churn.

## Key Metrics

The project tracks the following key performance indicators:

*   Total Customers
*   Total Churn & Churn Rate
*   New Joiners

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following key steps:
